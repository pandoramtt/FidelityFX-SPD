# Single Pass Downsampler - SPD

FidelityFX Single Pass Downsampler (SPD) provides an RDNA-optimized solution for generating up to 12 MIP levels of a texture.

# Sample Build Instructions

1. Clone submodules by running 'git submodule update --init --recursive' (so you get the Cauldron framework too)
2. Run sample/build/GenerateSolutions.bat
3. open solution, build + run + have fun ðŸ˜Š

# SPD Files
You can find them in ffx-spd
- ffx_a.h: helper file
- ffx_spd: contains the SPD function and integration documentation

# Sample
Downsampler
- PS: computes each mip in a separate pixel shader pass
- Multipass CS: computes each mip in a separate compute shader pass
- SPD CS: uses the SPD library, computes all mips (up to a source texture of size 4096Â²) in a single pass
- SPD CS linear sampler: uses the SPD library and for sampling the source texture a linear sampler

SPD Versions
- NO-WaveOps: uses only LDS to share the data between threads
- WaveOps: uses Intrinsics and LDS to share the data between threads

SPD Non-Packed / Packed Version
- Non-Packed: uses fp32
- Packed: uses fp16, reduced register pressure

# Recommendations
We recommend to use the WapeOps path when supported. If higher precision is not needed, you can enable the packed mode - it has less register pressure and can run a bit faster as well.
